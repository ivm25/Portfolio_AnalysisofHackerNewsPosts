# Portfolio_AnalysisofHackerNewsPosts

In this project, we anlyse the hacker news paots data set to understand which is the best time to generate more comments on posts.

**Assumptions: Having taken the data directly from Kaggle, we are assuming that it is largely a clean data set.**

***

The dataset is divided into two parts for analysis: Ask_posts and show_posts.
 1. For both the sets, average comments per posts are calculated and a reason the difference is hypothesized.

 2. After identifying the type of posts(ask/show) that generates more comments, we focus on the time of the day for ask_posts.

 3. Seperate dictionaries are then created to analyse comments/hour and counts/hour.

 4. In the end, average comments/hour are estimated and the conclusion is presented with summary statements.

To do (In progess)

Completing a deck for the project using python pptx package. The idea is to automate certain parts of the deck generation to 
save on time in the next projects.
